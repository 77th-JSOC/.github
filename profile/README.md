## Introduction

Welcome to the 77th JSOC! The unit was founded in late 2013 by a small group of players looking for more than just the ordinary gameplay provided by most servers. 
Even though the original focus was private gameplay soon after we decided to give back to the Arma community and open up a public server, not long after that a second server was opened as well.

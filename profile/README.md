## Overview

Welcome to the **77th Joint Special Operations Command (77th JSOC)** — a tactical Arma community built on teamwork, immersion, and camaraderie.  

Founded in **2013** by a small group of dedicated players seeking more than standard public gameplay, the unit began as a private group focused on realistic operations and coordination.  
As our team and experience grew, we opened our doors to the broader Arma community — launching a **public server** and later expanding to a **second server** to accommodate even more players who share our passion for authentic military simulation.

## What We Offer

- 🪖 **Authentic Tactical Gameplay** — Structured operations inspired by real-world military tactics.  
- 🧭 **Experienced Leadership** — Over a decade of mission-making, training, and event organization.  
- 🌍 **Active Community** — Players from around the world working together in coordinated ops.  
- 🛠️ **Custom Content & Servers** — Continually developed missions, mods, and dedicated infrastructure.
